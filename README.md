A Windows 10 device, phone, and pretty much anything that connects to a network has a unique identification number known as the media access control (MAC) address embedded on the physical network adapter (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth), and it's a necessary component, alongside the Internet Protocol (IP) address, to allow communication between devices inside a local network.

Although, for the most part, you never have to worry about this information, sometimes you may need to find out the MAC address of the network adapter, for example, to identify the device or configure networking permissions on a router.

Whatever the reason it might be, Windows 10 includes several ways to determine the hardware address using the Settings app, PowerShell, Command Prompt, Control Panel, and even using System Information.
